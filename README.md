🌊 Marine Plastic Pollution Detection using Deep Learning
CNN vs ResNet50 Transfer Learning
Project Overview

Marine plastic pollution poses a serious threat to ocean ecosystems and biodiversity. This project develops a deep learning–based image classification system capable of automatically identifying plastic waste in underwater images.

The project compares two deep learning approaches:

* Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

* ResNet50 Transfer Learning Model

The goal is to evaluate performance differences between training a model from scratch and leveraging pretrained deep learning architectures.

-> Objectives

Detect plastic waste in underwater images

Compare CNN vs Transfer Learning performance

Apply data augmentation to improve generalization

Evaluate models using classification metrics and confusion matrices

Build an end-to-end deep learning pipeline

* Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

ResNet50 (Transfer Learning)

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

PIL (Image Processing)

Jupyter Notebook

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project begins with dataset inspection:

Image count per class

Class distribution visualization

Random sample image visualization

Bar plots were generated to verify dataset balance across training and testing sets.

* Data Preprocessing & Augmentation

Images were resized to:

224 × 224 pixels

Training Augmentation

Rescaling

Rotation

Zooming

Width & height shifting

Horizontal flipping

ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1./255,
    rotation_range=30,
    zoom_range=0.2,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True
)


This improves model robustness and prevents overfitting.

 Model Architectures
1️ Custom CNN Model

Architecture:

Removed top classification layers

Froze base layers

Added custom dense layers

Applied dropout regularization

Architecture extension:

ResNet50 → Flatten → Dense(512) → Dropout → Sigmoid Output


Learning Rate:

1e-4 (Adam Optimizer)

* Model Training

Both models were trained for:

10 epochs
Batch size: 32


Validation accuracy comparison was plotted to analyze performance differences.

* Model Evaluation

Evaluation metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Confusion Matrix

Using:

classification_report()
confusion_matrix()


Confusion matrices were visualized using Seaborn heatmaps.

* Prediction System

The project includes a prediction pipeline that:

Loads a local image

Applies preprocessing

Performs classification

Displays prediction result

Example output:

Prediction: Plastic / No-Plastic

* Model Deployment Step

Best performing model saved as:

marine_pollution_resnet50.h5


This allows reuse without retraining.

*Key Insights

Transfer learning significantly improves performance with limited datasets.

ResNet50 extracts stronger visual features compared to a custom CNN.

Data augmentation improves generalization on underwater imagery.

Environmental datasets benefit greatly from pretrained architectures.
